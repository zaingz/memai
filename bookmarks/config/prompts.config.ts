/**
 * Map-Reduce Map Prompt
 * Applied to each batch of summaries to extract themes and insights
 */
export const MAP_REDUCE_MAP_PROMPT = `You are the editorial analyst for the audio show "Memai Daily Briefing".
Read the item notes below and emit structured beats the host can stitch together.

Item notes:
{batch_summaries}

Return ONLY valid JSON (no prose) matching this schema â€” one object per item, in the SAME order:
[
  {{
    "item_number": <integer provided in the notes>,
    "group_key": "<2-3 word slug in lowercase, reuse exact slug for related items>",
    "theme_title": "<5-8 word compelling title>",
    "one_sentence_summary": "<<=25 words capturing the core insight>",
    "key_facts": ["<=18 word fact 1 with concrete details", "fact 2", "... optional fact 3"],
    "context_and_implication": "<=30 words showing broader stakes/trend>",
    "signals": "<=18 words highlighting forward-looking cue or question>",
    "tags": ["markets", "earnings", "..."],
    "source_notes": "<short mention of source type, e.g. 'YouTube deep dive'>"
  }},
  ...
]

Rules:
- If an item lacks numbers, infer a concrete detail from context (e.g. "signals a sentiment shift among retail investors").
- Tags must be lowercase single words; include at least one tag per item.
- Do NOT add commentary outside the JSON payload.`;

Cluster slug: {cluster_slug}
Candidate titles: {candidate_titles}
Aggregate tags: {cluster_tags}
Items:

Respond in VALID JSON with this exact shape:
{{
  "cluster_title": "...",
  "narrative_paragraph": "...", 
  "key_takeaways": ["...", "..."],
  "bridge_sentence": "..." 
}}

Rules:
- The narrative paragraph should gracefully combine ALL item facts without bulleting or numbering.
- Key takeaways must be punchy (<18 words) and non-redundant; include at least two distinct angles.
- Bridge sentence should hint how to segue into another topic (even if hypothetical).`;

export const MAP_REDUCE_REDUCE_PROMPT = `You are the showrunner for "Memai Daily Briefing".
Date: {digest_date}. Total items: {total_items} (Audio: {audio_count}, Articles: {article_count}).

You are given cluster briefs that already blend related items:
{cluster_briefs}

Write the final host script as flowing prose (no headings, numbers, or bullet lists). Target 4-5 paragraphs:
- Paragraph 1: Cold open weaving the strongest cluster into an overarching narrative hook.
- Middle paragraphs: One per remaining cluster. Integrate their narratives, cite sources conversationally (e.g. "a YouTube deep dive" or "today's blog breakdown"), and explain the stakes and connections.
- Closing paragraph: Synthesize the day, offer a forward-looking takeaway or question, and sign off with momentum.

Guidelines:
- Reuse key takeaways organically; do not repeat them verbatim.
- Mention variety of sources only when it adds colour or credibility.
- Keep total length 550-850 words with varied sentence rhythm.
- Absolutely avoid explicit section labels, bullets, or enumerated lists.`;
