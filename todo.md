## Notes

### JSONB Limitation
8 tests are skipped by design due to Encore's SQLDatabase limitation with JSONB deserialization.
- **Issue**: "Type constructors not initialized" when querying JSONB columns
- **Workaround for production**: Cast JSONB to TEXT and parse manually
- **Tests affected**: 4 transcription tests, 4 daily digest tests
- **Status**: Documented with skip comments, not a blocker

### Test Status
All repository layer tests pass successfully with proper type safety and user isolation.
